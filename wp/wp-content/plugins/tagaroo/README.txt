Use tagaroo to get semantic data to use as tags and photo for your posts.

== Description ==

Tagaroo gives you an integration between your WordPress blog and the Calais web service. Tagaroo fetches semantic data (people, places, events, etc.) relevant to your blog post that you can use as tags. Tagaroo will also use these tags to search Flickr for appropriately licensed images for you to use in your blog posts.

== Installation == 

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Upload the tagaroo directory to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for tagaroo.
4. Go to Settings > Tagaroo and follow the instructions to register for your Calais API key.
5. Enter your API key, set your preferences for allowing your content to be indexed or not, and press the Update tagaroo Options button.
6. Congratulations, you've just installed tagaroo!

== Usage ==

While writing blog posts, tagaroo will request appropriate tags and photos for you. You can also click the "Suggest Tags" link at any time to get tags.

You can enter your own tags, or use tags suggested by tagaroo. You can drag tags from the suggested tags list to the Post Tags area, or click on them to add them.

You can also drag tags up to the tagaroo images list and tagaroo will search Flickr for photos for that tag. You can sort the returned photos by interestingness, date take and date posted.

Clicking on a photo will show you a larger preview of the photo, and you can choose the size of the photo you want to add to your post.

== Known Issues ==

The WordPress auto-save feature does not save all tagaroo tag data, be sure to use the Save/Publish button to make sure all of the tagaroo meta data is saved properly.
