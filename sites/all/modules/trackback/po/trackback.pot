"The trackback module allows users to give a blog post a contextual "
"link to another. A context is made because the trackbacking poster "
"is, in theory, writing about something mentioned on another blogger's "
"trackbacked post.  Using the trackback URL accompanying each post, "
"another website can send a ping to your website. Once received, the "
"trackback will show up on the trackback page accompanying the post.  "
"It also includes auto-discovery, spam moderation queues, and the "
"ability to manually ping another site."

"If trackback autodisovery is enabled on your website, someone need "

"trackback. Trackback auto-discovery also works internally within a "
"website, automatically creating connections between pages which link "
"to each other. To manually send a ping to another site, edit your "
"post and use the trackback URL field at the bottom of the edit page "
"to submit the trackback URL for the post on the other site. Once you "
"enter submit, your website will ping the other site for you. With "
"trackback autodiscovery enabled, your site will attempt to do this "
