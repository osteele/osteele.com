------------------------------------------------
- No changes yet.


Akismet module v1.1.2 for Drupal 4.7, 2006-06-20
------------------------------------------------
- Fixed bug: Do not apply anti-spambot checks if there have already
  been errors detected in the form.
- Fixed bug: Do not check for empty body/mail in anti-spambot
  prevention code.
- Added a function to expand the SQL query used to match spambots.
  This is hopefully better, for debuggin purposes.


Akismet module v1.1.0 for Drupal 4.7, 2006-06-20
------------------------------------------------
- Added experimental feature: anti-spambot options to prevent from
  Denial of Service (DoS) caused by certain spambots.
- Rewritten moderation queue. It is now a bit more powerful, allowing
  operations against multiple items.
- Code related to admin and cron has been moved to external files
  which are only loaded when needed. This is to minimize resource
  consumption during normal site operation.
- Prevent from sending e-mail notifications to the same user who has
  written the content.
- Removed unnecessary code in hook_install.
- Added a couple of columns to the {akismet_spam_marks} table to
  speed up some queries. Requires running http://site/update.php
